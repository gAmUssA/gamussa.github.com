Time after time I create screencasts and I need to have clean desktop.
First, I tried to find available solution and have found <a href="http://manytricks.com/desktopcurtain/">Desktop Curtain</a>. I don’t need all this fanciness (different desktop wallpapers, customization) so $2.99 is overkill for me and for this taks.

So, I decide to create my own solution with help of shell and Alfred.
Googled for Mac OS X command and I created simple script what I wrapped after as Alfred Extension.

You can download Alfred Extension for my <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1585128/Toggle_Desktop_Icons.alfredextension">Dropbox</a>. To use it you need to have <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Alfred PowerPack</a> purchased. 
Cheers
