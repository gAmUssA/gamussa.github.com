== Intro

Instead of doing one blog at the end of the year, I will try to write one blog in 3 months (or maybe more) about travel and speaking engagements.
Even thought, 2016 just began, I was managed spoke 4-5 events.

== Conferences and User Groups icon:calendar[]

=== Toronto JUG, Toronto, CA

After a vacation with my family in beautiful Miami, FL,  it was a tough trip to Canada.
After a whole day of meetings with the clients and the prospects in Toronto, I was invited to speak at Toronto JUG.
It was a first time when Java User group event happened in the bar.

Literally!
The developers were able to eat, drink and enjoy the show by truly yours.
Felt myself as a struggling standup comedian.

Video is available https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToNgv_R6rQ[here]

=== Central Ohio Java User Group (COJUG), Dublin, OH

Another fascinating thing happened this year.
I never presented on the meetup event during the lunch time.
COJUG folks have found this format is more flexible.
Of course, they have a traditional "after work" format.

But with additional "lunch time event" COJUG members can be more flexible on time.
Some people have time during a lunch break, and some people have time after work.
I was very surprised when I realized that


=== DevNexus 2016, Atlanta, GA

DevNexus this year was a blast!
This year I did three talks!

=== New York Spring User Group, New York, NY

During a short stay at home, I did a talk at http://www.meetup.com/NYC-SUG/events/228892296/[New York Spring Users Meetup] where I talked about caching use cases in Spring Boot projects.

=== Chattanooga Developers Meetup, Chattanooga, TN

Chattanooga Cho-Cho was my final destination for this month.
Another group that prefer productive lunch breaks!
And they have live video stream from the event!
