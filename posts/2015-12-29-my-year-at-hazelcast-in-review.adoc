.TL;DR
NOTE: It has been an awesome year full travelling (roughly 20 states), POCs for the clients and the prospects, training (including public classes) and conference talks.
While I am already looking forward to 2016, here is a quick recap of my 2015 with Hazelcast.

2015 has been a _helluva_ of a year for me, which started off with a new job: http://next.javaheadbrain.com/posts/2014/12/13/goodbye-farata-hello-hazelcast.html[the Solutions Architect in Hazelcast] - Open Source In-Memory Data Grid company. 
In addition to travelling to over 20 states, I had <<events, numerous opportunities>> to share my programming experience and how to develop and deploy the distributed systems. 
I enjoyed the conference talks, http://blog.hazelcast.com/author/viktor-gamov/[blog posts], and podcasts (http://razbor-poletov.com[1], http://theartofprogramming.podbean.com/e/выпуск-№100-—-the-art-of-programming-java-learningдва-слова/[2], http://ctocast.com/post/135596766138/ctocast-15-виктор-гамов-Hazelcast[3] in Russian).


== Hazelcast Trainings icon:graduation-cap[]

As a part of https://hazelcast.com/services/solutions-team/[the solutions team at Hazelcast], I lead numerous training engagements for clients and open public classes in many places across the country, including Tampa, FL, Richmond, VA, New York, NY, Jersey City, NJ, Rockville, MD and Cary, NC.
Just a couple months ago we launched our training portal - https://university.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast University]. 
And I'm very pleased to tell you while it wasn't easy, we did it!
It has been rewarding to receive all the positive comments on the training labs.

By the way, don't hesitate to ping me on https://twitter.com/gamussa[Twitter] if you're interested in attending one of our courses online or in-person. 
I might even be able to provide you with discount!

== Conferences and Events icon:calendar[]

One of my favorite activities in 2015 was getting to speak at many JUGs and conferences.

== Contributions icon:code-fork[] 

When people ask me how one can contribute to an open source project, I suggest starting with something small but valuable like the documentation. 
It also helps to understand internal organizational mechanics of the project, the team, and the community. 
I did this myself! 
One of my first contributions to the project was a contribution to the http://hazelcast.org/mastering-hazelcast/[«Mastering Hazelcast»] book. 

TIP: If you want to learn something more beyond http://hazelcast.org/documentation/[official documentation] (which is awesome. Kudos to the documentation team!) I highly recommend this book by Hazelcast Quality, Stability and Performance team lead https://twitter.com/PeterVeentjer[Peter Veentjer].

I helped the team to improve usability by converting exciting sources from LaTeX to asciidoc. With http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] tool we could render both online, https://hazelcast.com/resources/mastering-hazelcast/[PDF] and http://bit.ly/1QWWbrZ[icon:book[] EPUB] versions.

Another important part of Hazelcast open source infrastructure is the collection of code samples. I contributed https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+author%3AgAmUssA[a number of samples] including Hazelcast integration with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/mongodb[MongoDB], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/jcache[JCache] and https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/springboot-caching[Spring Boot].

Couple months ago, our engineering team http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/protocol/1.0-developer-preview/client-protocol.html[published] specification of Open Client protocol for Hazelcast. 
This enables to anyone from the community to develop Hazelcast for any missing language. 
A couple of my team mates (including yours truly) have started https://github.com/hazelcast-incubator/hazelcast-nodejs-client[Hazelcast Node.js client project]. 
Currently, it's in pre-alpha state but it already can connect to Hazelcast cluster and perform some basic IMaps operation.
This is another great way to contribute to this open source project. 
Jump in!


== Plans for 2016 icon:expand[]

I'm looking forward to expanding the geography of my talks on Distributed Systems and Hazelcast  - We have confirmed the inaugural Hazelcast User Group meet-up for Toronto in February:
