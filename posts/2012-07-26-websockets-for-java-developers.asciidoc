= WebSockets for Java Developers. Princeton JUG talk slides
:awestruct-layout: post

Last tuesday I delivered presentation at Princeton JUG «WebSockets: The Current State of the Most Valuable HTML5 API». + HTML5 specification includes WebSockets, a new communication protocol
for the Web. It's becoming the best choice for building real-time Web
applications. I did an overview of the servers (including upcoming
JavaEE 7 RI - Glassfish 4) and frameworks that support WebSockets and
showed some use cases where WebSockets shine. At the end we had short
conversation  about various approaches for the server- and client-side
implementations of WebSockets that can be used in the Web applications
today.

Here are my slides from that presentation:
