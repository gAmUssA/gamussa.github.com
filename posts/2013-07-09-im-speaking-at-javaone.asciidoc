New achievement unlocked - I'm going to deliver the talk at JavaOne 2013! 
This year I will be talking about very demanding and interesting topic for me - about integration Java and JavaScript.

This year I will be talking about very demanding and interesting topic for me - about integration Java and JavaScript.

Here is quick abstract of my *[BOF5793]* session:

""
There is a perception in the Java community that JavaScript is a second-rate interpreted language whose main purpose is to make Web pages a little prettier. But JavaScript is actually a powerful, flexible, dynamically typed language. And today the language has been experiencing a revival driven by the interest in HTML5. Nashorn is a modern JavaScript engine available on the JVM, and it's already included with JDK8 builds. This presentation is about building polyglot applications with Java and JavaScript.
""

Essentially, during this talk I will demonstrate how to leverage Java API from JavaScript and use both languages side-by-side in real-world use-cases like servlet programming, RESTful WebServices and etc. I have couple ideas regarding the examples for this sessions. I definitely will report about my experiments in this blog.
