== Testing Basics

In this chapter we are going to discuss the following types of testing (we don't cover QA and UAT in this book):

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Load (a.k.a. stress) tests

Let's go over the strategies, approaches, and tools that will help you in automation of each of the above tests.

=== Unit Testing

The _unit test_ is a piece of code that invokes the method or class being tested. It _asserts_ some assumptions about the application logic and behavior of the  method or class. You'll be writing unit tests using a unit-testing framework. The test should run fast, be automated and readable. For example you can test that if a function is called with a particular arguments, it should return an expected result.
We will take a closer look on unit testing terminology and vocabulary in a <<TDD>> section.
