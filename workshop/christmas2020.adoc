This is a brief manual for a workshop that taken place online at https://youtube.com/confluent

== Workshop prerequisites and setup

=== Prerequisites

Ensure you install the following toolset on your computer:

* https://confluent.cloud[Confluent Cloud]
+

TIP: You should have your login and password information handy after you sign up for Confluent Cloud.
The `ccloud` init script will ask you for your login information.

* https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/cli/install.html[Confluent Cloud CLI]
* Docker (We use Docker to build images locally)
** https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[install Docker Desktop for MacOS]
* Git
* https://jdk.dev[Java 11 (or later)]
* Your favorite IDE or text editor
** Personally, I recommend https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA].
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`] 
* https://k3d.io[`k3d`] to run a local Kubernetes cluster
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] for fancy json manipulation 
* https://skaffold.dev[`skaffold`] to build, run and deploy images
* https://k9scli.io[`k9s`] a fancy console GUI for Kubernetes

Before you proceed, be sure to complete the following steps:

===  Getting code

[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene            #<1>
cd streaming-movies-workshop                                    #<2>
----
<1> Clone the repository
<2> Change directory of the workshop folder

.Getting only what you need
****
If you follow steps below, you should check out only directory that has source code relevant to this post.

[source, shell script]
----
mkdir ~/temp/demo-scene
cd ~/temp/demo-scene
git init .
git remote add origin -f https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "streaming-movies-workshop/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull --depth=1 origin master
cd streaming-movies-workshop
ls -lh
----
// http://scriptedonachip.com/git-sparse-checkout
****

NOTE: If you are on Mac, you can use https://brew.sh[brew] to install all dependencies by running `make install-deps`.

== ☸️ Kubernetes

NOTE: You can try to deploy apps to local Kubernetes clusters.
There are plenty of options available - `minikube`, `k3d`, Docker for Desktop.
Frankly, I was having hard times to use those.
You can try local `minikube` cluster with `make create-local-minikube-cluster`.
In this tutorial, I will use Google Kubernetes Service to run my test apps.
If you want to follow same route you need to install https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Google Cloud SDK tools].
You can create GKE Kubernetes cluster by calling `make create-gke-cluster` command.
You can destroy GKE Kubernetes cluster after that by calling `make destroy-gke-cluster`.

== 0️⃣ Provisioning Confluent Cloud cluster

[source,shell script]
----
$ ccloud login --save       #<1>
$ make create-ccloud-cluster  #<2>
----
<1> Login to your Confluent Cloud account.
<2> The CCloud Stack script will ask you to log in to your CCloud account.

It will automatically provision Kafka and ksqlDB cluster.

== 1️⃣ Build and Deploy apps

This workshop includes two apps - the microservices developed with Spring Boot.
- `movies-generator` - loads movie data to Kafka cluster, and randomly generates new ratings.
- `ratings-processor` - processes new ratings, and constantly recalculates new rating for given movie. 

[source,shell script]
.Build and Smoke test
----
./gradlew test  #<1>
----
<1> This command will download gradle wrapper (if it wasn't previously installed )

=== Explore applications

* [ ] Model generation from AVRO Schema (`Movie`, `Rating`)
* [ ] Producer application using `KafkaTemplate`
* [ ] Ratings Processor App
** Explore tests using TTD
** Overview of the topologies using https://zz85.github.io/kafka-streams-viz/[Kafka Streams Topology Visualizer]

[source,shell script]
.deploy to Kubernetes
----
skaffold run #<1>
----
<1> This command will build images for
